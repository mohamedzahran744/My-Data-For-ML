    "## What is a Class?\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) \n",
    "and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Object?\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you're creating a specific \n",
    "example based on the class blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Class:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # Constructor method - initializes object attributes\n",
    "        self.attribute = value\n",

    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # Instance method - defines object behavior\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The __init__ Method (Constructor)\n",
    "- Special method that runs automatically when an object is created\n",
    "- Used to initialize object attributes with starting values\n",
    "- `self` refers to the instance being created\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The self Parameter\n",
    "- Represents the instance of the class\n",
    "- Must be the first parameter in all instance methods\n",
    "- Allows access to attributes and methods of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Attributes\n",
    "- Variables that belong to an object\n",
    "- Accessed using dot notation: object.attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Methods\n",
    "- Functions that belong to a class\n",
    "- Define what actions objects can perform\n",
    "- Called using dot notation: object.method()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name      # attribute\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def greet(self):          # method\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, I'm {self.name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
